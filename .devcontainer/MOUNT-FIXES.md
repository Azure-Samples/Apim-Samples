# Azure CLI Mount Configuration - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Mount Removal Problem
**Issue**: When selecting option 2 (manual login), the script was incorrectly removing ALL mounts from devcontainer.json, not just Azure CLI mounts.

**Root Cause**: The code used `del config["mounts"]` which removed the entire mounts section.

**Fix**: 
- Changed to selectively filter mounts by checking the `target` path
- Only remove mounts where `target.endswith("/.azure")`
- Preserve all other mounts (SSH keys, volumes, etc.)

### 2. Windows Platform Support
**Issue**: The configuration only had Unix mount settings (`${localEnv:HOME}/.azure`) but Windows needs `${localEnv:USERPROFILE}/.azure`.

**Fix**:
- Added proper Windows mount configuration using `${localEnv:USERPROFILE}/.azure`
- Improved platform detection and configuration selection
- Both Windows and Unix configurations now work correctly

## Code Changes

### Before (configure_azure_mount function):
```python
# Remove existing mounts section if present
if "mounts" in config:
    del config["mounts"]
```

### After (configure_azure_mount function):
```python
# Initialize mounts array if it doesn't exist
if "mounts" not in config:
    config["mounts"] = []

# Remove existing Azure CLI mounts (preserve other mounts)
existing_mounts = config["mounts"]
non_azure_mounts = []

for mount in existing_mounts:
    if isinstance(mount, dict):
        # Check if this is an Azure CLI mount by looking at the target path
        target = mount.get("target", "")
        if not target.endswith("/.azure"):
            non_azure_mounts.append(mount)
    else:
        # Keep non-dict mounts as-is
        non_azure_mounts.append(mount)

config["mounts"] = non_azure_mounts
```

## Mount Configurations

### Windows:
```json
{
  "source": "${localEnv:USERPROFILE}/.azure",
  "target": "/home/vscode/.azure",
  "type": "bind"
}
```

### Unix (Linux/macOS):
```json
{
  "source": "${localEnv:HOME}/.azure", 
  "target": "/home/vscode/.azure",
  "type": "bind"
}
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Enhanced Prompts
- Added clearer descriptions for each option
- Included pros/cons and use case recommendations
- Better visual formatting with emojis and spacing
- More informative feedback about what happens with each choice

### Non-Interactive Environment Detection
- Automatically detects GitHub Codespaces and other non-interactive environments
- Safely defaults to option 2 (manual login) for maximum compatibility
- Provides clear messaging about automatic selection

### Mount Preservation
- Intelligently preserves existing mounts (SSH, volumes, etc.)
- Only manages Azure CLI-specific mounts
- Users don't lose custom development setup

## Testing Verification

All fixes were tested with comprehensive test cases:
- ✅ Mount preservation with mixed mount types
- ✅ Windows mount configuration
- ✅ Unix mount configuration
- ✅ Selective Azure mount removal
- ✅ Platform detection

## Files Modified

1. `configure-azure-mount.py` - Main fix implementation
2. `README.md` - Updated documentation reflecting new behavior
3. `devcontainer.json` - Test configurations (restored to original state)

## Impact

- **Windows users** can now properly mount their Azure CLI configuration
- **All users** retain their custom mounts when choosing manual login
- **GitHub Codespaces** works reliably with automatic fallback
- **Cross-platform compatibility** is fully maintained
- **User experience** is significantly improved with clearer guidance

The fixes ensure robust, cross-platform Azure CLI authentication setup while preserving user customizations and providing clear, actionable guidance for all scenarios.
