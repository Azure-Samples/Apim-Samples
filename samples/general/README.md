# Samples: General

Sets up a simple APIM instance with a variety of policies to experiment.

⚙️ **Supported infrastructures**: All infrastructures

👟 **Expected *Run All* runtime (excl. infrastructure prerequisite): ~1 minute**

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Experience a variety of policies in any of the infrastructure architectures. You may see several examples from our [APIM policy snippets repo](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-policy-snippets).
1. Become proficient with how policies operate.
1. Gain confidence in setting up and configuring policies appropriately.

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. Decide which of the [Infrastructure Architectures](../../README.md#infrastructure-architectures) you wish to use.
    1. If the infrastructure _does not_ yet exist, navigate to the desired [infrastructure](../../infrastructure/) folder and follow its README.md.
    1. If the infrastructure _does_ exist, adjust the `user-defined parameters` in the _Initialize notebook variables_ below. Please ensure that all parameters match your infrastructure.
