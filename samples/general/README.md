# Samples: General

Sets up a simple APIM instance with a variety of policies to experiment.

⚙️ **Supported infrastructures**: All infrastructures

👟 **Expected *Run All* runtime (excl. infrastructure prerequisite): ~1 minute**

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Experience a variety of policies in any of the infrastructure architectures. You may see several examples from our [APIM policy snippets repo][apim-policy-snippets].
1. Become proficient with how policies operate.
1. Gain confidence in setting up and configuring policies appropriately.

## 🔗 APIs

| API Name                      | What does it do?                                                                                                                  |
|:------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Request Headers               | Returns a list of the request headers sent to APIM. Useful for debugging.                                                         |
| API ID                        | Returns the ID of an API as per a predefined standard such as `api-123`. Useful for explicitly identifying an API in telemetry.   |

## ⚙️ Configuration

1. Decide which of the [Infrastructure Architectures](../../README.md#infrastructure-architectures) you wish to use.
1. Press `Run All` in this sample's `create.ipynb` notebook.
