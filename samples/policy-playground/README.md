# Policy Playground Samples

General policy playground to experiment with APIM policies not necessarily as part of a larger theme such as auth, etc.

## Objectives

1. Experience a variety of policies in any of the infrastructure architectures. You may see several examples from our [APIM policy snippets repo](https://github.com/Azure/api-management-policy-snippets).
1. Become proficient with how policies operate.
1. Gain confidence in setting up and configuring policies appropriately.

## Configuration

1. Decide which of the [Infrastructure Architectures](../../README.md#infrastructure-architectures) you wish to use.
    1. If the infrastructure _does not_ yet exist, navigate to the desired [infrastructure](../../infrastructure/) folder and follow its README.md.
    1. If the infrastructure _does_ exist, adjust the `user-defined parameters` in this lab's Jupyter Notebook's [Initialize notebook variables](./create.ipynb#initialize-notebook-variables) section. Please ensure that all parameters match your infrastructure.

## Execution

1. Execute this lab's [Jupyter Notebook](./create.ipynb) step-by-step or via _Run All_.
